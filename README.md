# xkcd-manpage

A collection of man pages inspired by [this comic](https://xkcd.com/1692). The page shown in the comic is [this one](blerp.6), and the others were spawned by its `SEE ALSO` section. If you have a spare minute, check them out (they're stubs right now) and maybe have a chuckle.

There isn't much content in most of the pages yet (In fact, we're missing the ones implied by the alt-text), but that will hopefully change with time. If you have an idea, feel free to request it, or better yet, contribute it by making a pull request!
