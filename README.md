# [xkcd-manpage](https://xkcd.com/1692)

A collection of man pages inspired by [this comic](https://xkcd.com/1692). The page shown in the comic is [this one](blerp.6), and the others were spawned by its `SEE ALSO` section. If you have a spare minute, check them out (they're stubs right now) and maybe have a chuckle.

There isn't much content in most of the pages yet, but that will (hopefully) change with time. If you have an idea, feel free to request it, or better yet, make a pull request!
